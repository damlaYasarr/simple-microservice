notes for microservices

* there should be microservices arthitecture instead of the monolithic architecture  
* each microservices has to work dependently. deployed independently so if there is a bug in a microservices, but others works
* there is huge amout of cost. responses can be late. cost has to be lower. 
* there is a gateway for communication before the microservices. 


## design for microservices 
* there has to be functional requirements
 - register/login
 - list all entries
 - writing enries
 - create headers and its own entry
